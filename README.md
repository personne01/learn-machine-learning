## Machine Learning Learning Repository
### Welcome to my Machine Learning Learning Repository! 🎓🤖

This repository documents my journey in learning Machine Learning (ML) through code, notes, and small projects.

##### 📌 What's Inside
- Basic Python for Data Science

- Linear Algebra & Statistics for ML foundation

- Supervised & Unsupervised Learning

- Model Evaluation & Optimization

- Hands-on Projects using:

	- NumPy

	- Pandas

	- Matplotlib & Seaborn

	- Scikit-Learn


### 🚀 Goals
- Understand core concepts of Machine Learning
- Build small ML models from scratch and with libraries
- Prepare for real-world ML projects and AI applications

#### 🛠️ How to Use
-  Clone the repository
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate   # Mac / Linux
.venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
```


- Create and activate a virtual environment
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate   # Mac / Linux
.venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
```

- Install dependencies
